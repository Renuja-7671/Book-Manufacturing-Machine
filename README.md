# Book Manufacturing Machine

An automated exercise book manufacturing system designed for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). This Level 01 microcontroller-based hardware project provides a cost-effective solution for producing exercise books with minimal manual intervention.

## Project Overview

This machine automates the complete process of exercise book manufacturing including:
- Paper cutting and feeding
- Stapling
- Book folding
- Quality control with IR sensors

## Team

**ITM Group-04** - A team of 5 dedicated engineering students

## Hardware Components

- **Microcontroller**: Arduino-based control system
- **Display**: 16x2 LCD with I2C interface
- **Input**: 4x4 Keypad for user interaction
- **Motors**: 
  - Stepper motors for precise movement control
  - Wiper motor for folding mechanism
- **Sensors**: IR sensors for paper detection and positioning
- **Actuators**: Stapler mechanism for book binding

## Features

- **Automated Process**: Complete book manufacturing with single button press
- **Quality Control**: IR sensor-based paper detection and positioning
- **User Interface**: LCD display with status messages
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error detection and buzzer alerts
- **Precise Control**: Stepper motor-driven cutting and folding mechanisms

## Manufacturing Process

1. **Paper Detection**: IR sensors verify paper availability
2. **Cutting**: Automated paper cutting for multiple sheets
3. **Stapling**: Precise stapling mechanism binds the pages
4. **Transport**: Motorized tray moves books through stations
5. **Folding**: Automated folding unit creates final book shape
6. **Quality Check**: Final IR sensor confirms successful completion

## Control System

The system is controlled by Arduino with the following key functions:

```cpp
// Main process functions
void cutterNormal()     // Paper cutting mechanism
void staple()           // Stapling operation
void trayFoward()       // Move tray to folding station
void foldingUnit()      // Book folding process
void trayBackward()     // Return tray to start position
```
